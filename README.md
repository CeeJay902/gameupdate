# BattleRPG
Created when I was in High School and was heavily inspired by anime. This is how I taught myself php and mysql. Its a text-based online rpg using MCCodes as a framework. Start the game as any type of race inspired by popular anime shows: ninja(Naruto), Martial Artist(Dragon ball Z), Shinigami(Bleach), etc. Earn points killing other players in the battle arena and leveling up to become stronger.
